This site is a space for questions - those restless, open-ended thoughts that refuse easy answers. Here, i assemble the ideas that linger in my mind, the ones i wrestle with daily, hoping to understand them more. Honestly, it took me time to accept sharing these publicly, but I wonder if you might find them interesting too, and I hope you’ll join the conversation. 

Each question includes **a comment** section via [disqus](https://disqus.com/), where you’re invited to share your thoughts, reflections, or even new questions that might arise. To join the conversation simply log in to disqus or sign up for free with one of your social accounts or email - it’s quick and allows you to engage directly on each question page.

If you wish to reference or cite this platform in your work, please use the following format:
```bash
kante, M. (year). title of the question or page. retrieved from https://questions.mkante.ml.
Date and time of access.
```

Each question is an original exploration of philosophical and sometimes my naive ideas, and proper citation respects the intent and effort behind this work. Thank you
